## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SCAFFOLDING FIRST

**Before working on ANY task, check if Issue #15 (Scaffolding) is complete.**

```bash
gh issue view 15
```

- If #15 is **OPEN**: You are the Scaffolding Agent. Work on #15 first.
- If #15 is **CLOSED**: Scaffolding is complete. Proceed to your assigned issue.

**All issues #1-#14 are BLOCKED until #15 is merged to main.**

| File | Use When... |
|------|-------------|
| `skills/sapui5.md` | Developing SAPUI5/UI5 applications |
| `PRD.md` | Understanding product requirements |
| `PLAN.md` | Reviewing execution plan |

## Project Setup

**Tech Stack:** SAPUI5 1.120+, JavaScript (ES6+), FastAPI, SQLite, LiteLLM

---

### 🚫 MANDATORY: Use `uv` for Python (NOT venv/pip)

**DO NOT use `python -m venv`, `pip install`, or `virtualenv`.**

This project uses **uv** - a fast, Rust-based Python package manager.

---

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Frontend setup
npm install

# 3. Backend setup (using uv - NOT pip)
cd backend
uv venv                              # Creates .venv directory
source .venv/bin/activate            # Activate environment
uv pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies (10-100x faster than pip)
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Frontend (from project root)
npm start          # Start dev server (localhost:8080)
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run lint       # Run UI5 linter

# Backend (from backend/)
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # Start API (localhost:8000)
pytest             # Run tests
```

### uv Quick Reference

```bash
uv venv                          # Create virtual environment (.venv)
uv pip install <package>         # Install a package
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install from requirements
uv pip list                      # List installed packages
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt # Export dependencies
```

## For litellm setup with generative AI Hub

- Refer to installation guide at https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/sap

## Code Rules

- Use `sap.ui.define` for all modules—no globals
- Use async loading (`data-sap-ui-async="true"`)
- Use i18n for all user-facing text
- No deprecated APIs (`jQuery.sap.*`, sync loading)
- XML views only

## Multi-Agent Development (9 Agents)

This project uses **9 parallel Claude agents** working on isolated branches via Git worktrees.

### ⚠️ Scaffolding Agent Runs First

The Scaffolding Agent (#15) must complete and merge before any other agent starts work.

### Worktree Structure

| Directory | Branch | Agent | Issue(s) |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| `demo2-scaffold/` | `feature/scaffolding` | **Scaffolding** | #15 (FIRST) |
| `demo2/` | `main` | Orchestrator | #13 |
| `demo2-fe1/` | `feature/frontend-dev-1` | Frontend Dev 1 | #1, #7 |
| `demo2-fe2/` | `feature/frontend-dev-2` | Frontend Dev 2 | #2, #8 |
| `demo2-be1/` | `feature/backend-dev-1` | Backend Dev 1 | #3, #9 |
| `demo2-be2/` | `feature/backend-dev-2` | Backend Dev 2 | #4, #10 |
| `demo2-prompt/` | `feature/prompt-engineer` | Prompt Engineer | #5, #11 |
| `demo2-qa/` | `feature/problem-finder` | Problem Finder | #6, #12 |
| `demo2-devops/` | `feature/devops` | DevOps | #14 |

### Execution Order

```
Phase 0: Scaffolding Agent completes #15 and merges to main
    ↓
Phase 1: All 8 agents rebase on main and start their first issue (#1-#6, #13, #14)
    ↓
Phase 2: Agents complete second issues (#7-#12) after first issues merge
```

### Starting an Agent Session

```bash
# STEP 1: Scaffolding Agent (MUST RUN FIRST)
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-scaffold && claude
> Work on issue #15

# STEP 2: After #15 is merged, start remaining agents
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2 && claude          # Orchestrator
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-fe1 && claude      # Frontend Dev 1
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-fe2 && claude      # Frontend Dev 2
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-be1 && claude      # Backend Dev 1
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-be2 && claude      # Backend Dev 2
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-prompt && claude   # Prompt Engineer
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-qa && claude       # Problem Finder
cd /Users/I769068/projects/scaling-productivity/demo2-devops && claude   # DevOps
```

## Agent Startup Checklist

When starting a new session:

1. **Check if scaffolding is complete:**
   ```bash
   gh issue view 15
   ```
   - If OPEN and you're in `demo2-scaffold/`: Work on #15
   - If OPEN and you're elsewhere: STOP - wait for #15 to complete
   - If CLOSED: Continue to step 2

2. **Check GitHub auth:** `gh auth status`

3. **Sync with main:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. **View your issues:**
   ```bash
   gh issue list --label "track-a"     # Frontend agents
   gh issue list --label "track-b"     # Backend agents
   gh issue list --label "track-c"     # Prompt Engineer
   gh issue list --label "qa"          # Problem Finder
   gh issue list --label "integration" # Orchestrator, DevOps
   ```

5. **Pick ONE issue** and add `in-progress` label:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --add-label "in-progress"
   ```

6. **Do the work** - implement, test, document

7. **Complete the full cycle** (see below)

---

## Task & Issue Tracking

**GitHub Issues is the single source of truth for all task management.**

### ONE TASK AT A TIME RULE

Complete the full cycle for one issue before starting another. Do not work on multiple issues simultaneously.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Complete Task Workflow

**Every task MUST follow this exact sequence. No exceptions. No skipping steps.**

### Step 1: START - Claim the Issue
```bash
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "in-progress"
```

### Step 2: CODE - Implement the Changes
- Write the code for the issue
- Follow all code rules (i18n, no globals, async loading, etc.)

### Step 3: TEST - Run ALL Tests (MANDATORY GATE)

**⛔ YOU CANNOT PROCEED TO STEP 4 UNTIL ALL TESTS PASS ⛔**

Run these commands and verify they ALL pass:

```bash
# Frontend tests (run from project root)
npm run lint                    # MUST show 0 errors
npm start &                     # Start dev server
# Use Playwright MCP to test UI (see below)

# Backend tests (run from backend/) - USE UV, NOT PIP
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate       # Note: .venv (not venv)
pytest                          # MUST show all tests pass
pytest --cov=app                # Check coverage (optional but recommended)
```

**Frontend UI Testing with Playwright MCP:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Take screenshots of key UI states
3. Test all user interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
4. Verify no console errors in browser

**If ANY test fails:**
- DO NOT proceed to commit
- Fix the issue first
- Re-run ALL tests
- Only continue when everything passes

### Step 4: DOCUMENT - Update CHANGELOG.md
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- <describe what you added for issue #X>
```

### Step 5: COMMIT - Create a Git Commit
```bash
git add <specific-files>        # Add only relevant files
git status                      # Verify what's being committed
git commit -m "feat: <description>. Closes #<number>"
```

### Step 6: PUSH - Push to Remote Branch
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Step 7: PR - Create Pull Request
```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "<type>: <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <what this PR does>

## Testing Done
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (0 errors)
- [ ] `pytest` passes (all tests)
- [ ] UI tested with Playwright MCP
- [ ] Screenshots taken

## Issue
Closes #<number>
EOF
)"
```

### Step 8: WAIT - Wait for PR to be Merged
- The Orchestrator will review and merge your PR
- Check PR status: `gh pr view <pr-number>`
- **DO NOT start the next issue until your PR is merged**

### Step 9: SYNC - Update Your Branch After Merge
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

### Step 10: NEXT - Start Next Issue
- Only now can you pick your next issue
- Return to Step 1

---

## 🚫 HARD RULES - Never Break These

1. **NO COMMIT WITHOUT PASSING TESTS** - If `npm run lint` or `pytest` fails, you cannot commit
2. **NO PR WITHOUT TESTING** - Every PR must include proof that tests passed
3. **NO STARTING NEXT ISSUE** - Until current PR is merged to main
4. **ONE ISSUE AT A TIME** - Never work on multiple issues simultaneously
5. **ALWAYS CREATE A PR** - Every completed task needs a PR, no direct pushes to main
6. **USE UV ONLY** - Never use `pip`, `venv`, or `virtualenv`. Always use `uv venv` and `uv pip install`

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- Branch from up-to-date main
- Format: `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
- Types: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

### Commit Format
- Format: `<type>: <short description>` (50 chars max)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #57`, `Part of #42`

### Syncing with Main

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
git push origin <branch> --force-with-lease
```

### Creating and Merging PRs

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "Description" --body "Closes #<number>"
gh pr merge <number> --squash
```

---

## Changelog Management

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` as a **first-class artifact**.

### When to Update
- After completing a feature or fix
- When deferring or rejecting an approach (document why)
- Before ending a work session

### Format

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature description

### Changed
- Modified behavior description

### Deferred
- Feature X - Rationale: reason
```

---

## UI Testing with Playwright MCP

**All UI testing MUST use Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol).**

When testing frontend functionality:
1. Use Playwright MCP to automate browser interactions
2. Take screenshots to verify UI rendering
3. Test user flows end-to-end (navigation, forms, data display)
4. Verify responsive behavior if applicable

Playwright MCP commands are available through the MCP tools. Use them for:
- Opening pages and navigating
- Clicking buttons and links
- Filling forms
- Taking screenshots
- Asserting element visibility and content

**Do not rely solely on manual testing.** Playwright MCP provides automated, repeatable UI verification.

---

## Verification Checklist (Pre-Commit Gate)

**⛔ ALL items must be checked before you can commit ⛔**

### Required Tests (must pass)
- [ ] `npm run lint` - 0 errors (frontend)
- [ ] `pytest` - all tests pass (backend)
- [ ] Playwright MCP UI test - screenshots taken, no errors

### Code Quality
- [ ] App runs without console errors (`npm start`)
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] i18n used for all user-facing text
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs or secrets
- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements left in code

### Documentation
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes

### Git Workflow
- [ ] Changes committed with proper message format
